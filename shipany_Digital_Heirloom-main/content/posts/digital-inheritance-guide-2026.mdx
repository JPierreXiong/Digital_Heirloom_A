# The 2026 Guide to Digital Inheritance: How to Secure Your Crypto Assets?

## Introduction

Studies show that over 20% of all Bitcoin has been permanently lost because owners passed away without leaving private keys. In the digital age, a traditional paper will is no longer enough to protect your wealth.

## Step 1: Inventory Your Digital Assets

Identify what needs to be passed on:

**Crypto Assets**: Seed phrases and exchange accounts.

**Digital Intellectual Property**: Domain names and social media ownership.

**Sensitive Credentials**: Online banking and safe-deposit box codes.

## Step 2: Choose the Right Tool

### Why not just share passwords?

Directly telling family members your passwords is risky:

**Security Vulnerabilities**: Plaintext records are easily stolen by hackers.

**Unintended Access**: Pre-sharing can lead to family disputes before the time is right.

This is why automated tools like Afterglow are essential.

## Step 3: Leveraging Afterglow's Three-Layer Protection
