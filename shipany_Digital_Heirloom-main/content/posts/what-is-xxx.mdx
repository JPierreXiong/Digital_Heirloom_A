# Afterglow: Guarding the Last Warmth in the Digital Wasteland

## Our Origin: Solving the Paradox of Forgetting

In the 21st century, we live dual lives: one physical, defined by breath and heartbeat; the other digital, defined by code, pixels, and encryption keys. We store memories on social media, essential documents in the cloud, and wealth in digital wallets.

However, a harsh reality is often ignored: when life ends in the physical world, our digital presence often falls into a permanent silence. Locked by master passwords and inaccessible private keys, these assets become "Digital Wastelands."

## The Birth of Afterglow: Bridging Time and Space

We chose the name Afterglow because we believe a person's value should not cease the moment their breathing stops. Like the gentle glow that lingers after the sun sets, your legacy should continue to illuminate and guide those you love. Afterglow is not just about "data transfer"; it is about honoring a final trust.

## Our Pillars: Zero-Knowledge & Physical Security

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Your data is encrypted locally before it ever reaches our servers. We never see your passwords or files. Even we cannot peek into your privacy.

### 180-Day Heartbeat

For Free users, we've designed a periodic check-in system—a silent contract ensuring the vault remains closed as long as you are present.

### Fragment A/B Logic

For Pro users, we integrate physical logistics via ShipAny. By splitting keys into digital and physical parts, we eliminate single points of failure.

## Our Vision: Dignity in the Digital Age

Afterglow protects not just your assets, but your dignity. We want everyone to face the future with peace of mind, knowing that accumulated wealth, unsent letters to children, and family memories will reach their destination safely, even when you can no longer speak for yourself.

Afterglow, guarding that never-fading digital warmth for you.
