# How to Pass Down Crypto Assets Safely in 2026

The greatest risk of self-custody is the "lost key" problem. If you hold your private keys, your assets die with you unless you have a plan. Traditional wills are slow and expose your seed phrases to third parties.

Afterglow offers a modern solution: the **Fragment A/B** model. By splitting your access key into two encrypted parts, you ensure that no single entity—not even Afterglow—can access your funds. One part stays in your secure vault, while the other is ready for delivery via our trusted partners like **ShipAny**. This is the future of secure, automated crypto inheritance.

## The Hidden Risk: Lost Keys

When you self-custody your crypto assets, you gain complete control—but also complete responsibility. If something happens to you, your Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets could be locked away forever. Studies show that over 20% of all Bitcoin has been permanently lost due to forgotten or inaccessible keys.

## Why Traditional Methods Fail

Simply writing down your seed phrase and storing it in a safe deposit box isn't enough:

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Physical records can be stolen, lost, or damaged
- **Legal Complexity**: Traditional probate processes are slow and may not recognize digital assets
- **Third-Party Risk**: Sharing keys with family members creates security and trust issues

## The Afterglow Solution: Fragment A/B Architecture

Our **Fragment A/B** model eliminates single points of failure:

1. **Fragment A**: Encrypted and stored in your zero-knowledge vault
2. **Fragment B**: Delivered to your heirs via secure physical or digital channels

Neither fragment alone can access your assets. Only when both are combined can your heirs unlock your digital legacy.

## Getting Started

1. **Create Your Vault**: Set up your Afterglow account and configure your master password
2. **Add Your Assets**: Securely store your seed phrases and private keys
3. **Set Up Beneficiaries**: Designate who should receive your digital inheritance
4. **Configure Heartbeat**: Set your check-in frequency (180 days for Free, 90 for Base, 30 for Pro)

## Conclusion

Don't let your crypto assets become permanently lost. With Afterglow's automated inheritance system, you can ensure your digital wealth is safely passed to your loved ones—without compromising security or privacy.
