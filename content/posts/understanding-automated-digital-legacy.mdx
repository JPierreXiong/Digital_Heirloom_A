# Why Every Digital Citizen Needs a Dead Man's Switch

What happens to your Google account, social media, or cloud storage when you stop logging in? "Digital silence" is a real issue. Afterglow's **Dead Man's Switch** acts as your digital executor. By setting a "Heartbeat" (check-in frequency), you tell the system you are still active. If the heartbeat stops, the system automatically triggers your predefined legacy plan. It's not just about money; it's about ensuring your digital footprint is managed according to your wishes.

## The Problem of Digital Silence

In our digital age, we accumulate vast amounts of digital assets:

- **Social Media Accounts**: Years of photos, memories, and connections
- **Cloud Storage**: Important documents, family photos, and personal files
- **Cryptocurrency Wallets**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies
- **Email Accounts**: Critical communications and account recovery links

When you're no longer able to manage these accounts, they become "digital ghosts"—locked away forever, inaccessible to your loved ones.

## How the Heartbeat Mechanism Works

Afterglow's Dead Man's Switch uses a simple but powerful concept: **periodic check-ins**.

1. **Set Your Frequency**: Choose how often you want to check in (30, 90, or 180 days)
2. **Stay Active**: Log in to your Afterglow account before the deadline
3. **Automatic Trigger**: If you miss a check-in, the system assumes you're unable to respond and triggers your legacy plan

This isn't about surveillance—it's about ensuring your digital assets are accessible when they're needed most.

## Why Traditional Methods Fall Short

**Paper Wills**: Slow, may not recognize digital assets, require probate court

**Sharing Passwords**: Security risk, creates trust issues, no automation

**Family Members**: May not understand technology, could lose access, emotional burden

## The Afterglow Advantage

- **Automated**: No manual intervention required
- **Secure**: Zero-knowledge encryption ensures privacy
- **Reliable**: Multiple delivery channels via **ShipAny** and digital methods
- **Flexible**: Configure different beneficiaries for different assets

## Real-World Scenarios

**Scenario 1**: You're traveling and lose internet access for an extended period. With Afterglow, you can extend your heartbeat deadline before you leave.

**Scenario 2**: You want to ensure your children receive your crypto assets when they turn 18. Afterglow allows you to set conditional triggers based on time or events.

**Scenario 3**: You have multiple beneficiaries with different access levels. Afterglow's Fragment A/B system ensures each receives only what they're entitled to.

## Getting Started

1. **Create Your Legacy Plan**: Define what happens to each type of digital asset
2. **Set Your Heartbeat**: Choose a frequency that matches your lifestyle
3. **Designate Beneficiaries**: Specify who should receive what
4. **Test the System**: Run a test to ensure everything works as expected

## Conclusion

Your digital legacy deserves the same care and planning as your physical assets. With Afterglow's Dead Man's Switch, you can ensure your digital footprint is managed according to your wishes—automatically, securely, and reliably.
